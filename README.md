Call Center Data Analysis: Hold Times and Escalation Incidents

This repository contains a project that analyzes call center performance data for Sleuth Goose Shipping Services,
focusing on the relationship between customer hold times and escalation incidents. 
The analysis aims to identify patterns in hold times throughout the week and determine
whether longer hold times are associated with increased escalations.

Project Overview:
Objective: Investigate the correlation between extended call hold times (exceeding five minutes) and escalation incidents in the call center.
Tools Used: Python, Jupyter Notebooks
Methods: Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and data visualization
Key Findings: A statistically significant relationship between longer hold times and escalations was found, providing insights for optimizing call center staffing and improving customer satisfaction.
Key Features:
Self-generated dataset mimicking typical call center operations
Data grouped by day of the week to analyze average hold times and escalations
Visualizations including bar charts, heatmaps, and histograms to display patterns
Statistical testing (chi-square) to determine the significance of findings
